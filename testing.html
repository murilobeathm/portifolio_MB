        <h2>what is software testing?</h2>

        <p>Software testing is a method for checking that the application developed meets the expected requirements and for ensuring that the program has no defects.

          In this flow, we have the execution of software and system components using some manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest.
          
          The aim of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements compared to the actual requirements.
          
          Another very common definition is that software testing is the combination of white box and black box testing, which we'll talk about later.</p>

          <h2>What is a software tester and what does he do?</h2>
          <p>A software tester is someone who tests an application for bugs, errors, defects or any problem that could affect the performance of the software on a computer or cell phone.

            Software testers are part of a software development team and carry out functional and non-functional testing of the application using manual and automated techniques.
            
            They mainly perform software quality testing procedures on the program. They are people who generally have a strong command of software quality testing tools and techniques, along with some level of knowledge or experience in software development. Thus, software testers ensure that the application operates as expected, in both functional and non-functional requirements.</p>

            <h2>What is the importance and benefits of testing software?</h2>
            <p>Cost-effectiveness: this is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps save money in the long run. If bugs are detected before software testing, it costs less to fix them. <br>
            Security: this is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing, as people look for reliable products on the market. Therefore, software testing helps to remove risks and problems early. <br>
            Product quality: this is an essential requirement of any software product and, with testing, the development team ensures that a quality product is delivered to customers. <br>
            Customer satisfaction: the main objective of any product is customer satisfaction. In this sense, UI/UX testing guarantees the best user experience.
            </p>

            <h2>What are the main techniques used in software testing?</h2>
            <p><span class="negrito">Regression testing:</span> Changes and updates are made to software on an ongoing basis. Therefore, regression testing ensures that new versions or updates have not created problems for other areas that were working well. The test is carried out using previous test cases and the new results compared with the previous results.</p>
            <p><span class="negrito">Black box testing: </span>This is the testing done on the entire system by people who have no idea about the design, structure and implementation of the software. It is tested for errors in the interface, performance, behavior, data structures, functions, etc.</p>
            <p><span class="negrito">White box testing: </span>White box testing is so named because the tester has access to the internal structure of the application. Therefore, its focus is to ensure that the software components are concise.</p>
            <p><span class="negrito">Gray box testing: </span>A test that comprises the two ideals of black box and white box testing: some parts of the item's design, structure and implementation are known to the tester and others are not.</p>

         <h2>Conclusion </h2>
          <p><span class="negrito">I've given you just a glimpse of the field of software testing, which is constantly evolving and full of challenges. If you're interested, I recommend that you explore more about the various aspects of this profession. Software quality assurance is essential to the success of any digital product!</span></p>
